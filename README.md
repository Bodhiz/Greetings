Greetings App
==============

My AngularJS sandbox app. This app lets you send a customized greetings card from a Mandrill template.



# Quick Start 

* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies

```
* Run grunt server 
 ```
grunt serv

# Grunt task 

- `grunt serv` runs local server including livereload and watcher

- `grunt deploy` deploys the optimized project on GitHub gh-pages branch
